#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to software development to ensure efficiency, reliability, and scalability. It is crucial in the tech industry as it enables the creation of high-quality, secure, and maintainable software, driving 
  innovation in AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity.  


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1. Birth of Software Engineering – Introduced to address the software crisis, leading to structured programming.  
  2. Rise of Object-Oriented Programming  – OOP languages like C++ and Java improved modularity and reusability.  
  3. Agile Methodology – The Agile Manifesto revolutionized development with iterative, flexible approaches.  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1. Planning – Define goals, scope, and resources.  
  2. Requirement Analysis – Gather and document user needs.  
  3. Design – Create system architecture and UI/UX.  
  4. Implementation – Write and develop the software.  
  5. Testing – Identify and fix bugs before deployment.  
  6. Deployment – Release software to users.  
  7. Maintenance – Provide updates and fixes.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
       Waterfall               Agile 

 Sequential, step-by-step     Iterative, flexible 
 Hard to accommodate          Easily adaptable 
 Done after development       Continuous testing 
 One-time final release       Incremental releases 

- Waterfall Example: Banking systems where strict, fixed requirements are needed.  
- Agile Example: Mobile app development where features evolve over time. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  1. Software Developer – Writes, tests, and optimizes code.  
  2. QA Engineer – Tests software for bugs, security, and performance.  
  3. Project Manager – Oversees project timelines, resources, and team coordination.  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   - IDEs improve productivity by combining code editing, debugging, and testing in one tool. Examples: VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA.  
   - VCS tracks code changes, enabling collaboration and version control. Examples: Git (GitHub, GitLab), SVN. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   1. Debugging Complex Issues– Use logs, debugging tools, and systematic testing.  
   2. Tight Deadlines – Prioritize tasks and use Agile methods.  
   3. Keeping Up with Tech– Continuous learning through courses and projects.  
   4. Collaboration Issues – Use clear documentation and version control.  
   5. Security Concerns – Follow secure coding practices and conduct security testing.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   1. Unit Testing – Tests individual components for early bug detection.  
   2. Integration Testing – Ensures modules work together correctly.  
   3. System Testing – Evaluates the entire system for requirement compliance.  
   4. Acceptance Testing – Confirms the software meets business and user needs.  
   Each type ensures software reliability and quality.  

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
   Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting precise inputs to guide AI responses effectively. It is important as it improves AI accuracy, reduces ambiguity, and ensures relevant outputs in chatbots, coding assistants, and automation tools.  

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting precise inputs to guide AI responses effectively. It is important as it improves AI accuracy, reduces ambiguity, and ensures relevant outputs in chatbots, coding assistants, and automation tools.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague Prompt: "Tell me about AI."
  Improved Prompt: "Explain artificial intelligence in simple terms, including its types and real-world applications."
  
  Why the Improved Prompt is Better:
    Specifies clarity (simple terms).
    Defines scope (types and applications).
    Ensures a focused and relevant response from AI.
